__<h1>HMRITM APP</h1>__
---
__<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>__

_Whether it's a simple __checkmark__ next to the name, a verbal attendence or just lots of worries of whether the teacher listened my __'present ma'am'__ or not -- it's got to be done everyday -- even every lecture. Confused about the day-to-day __schedule__ of fresher's party to fest, sessionals to finals, VAPS to summer training. Or just swiping your phone gallery to find the __assignment__ posted last month in the class group._

__It's lot to keep a track of -- but not to worry. With the advancement in technology__ _(without what the heck we can think off)_ __our app will help to reduce teacher's as well as student's effort.__

__<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>__
The project we proposed `HMRITM APP` has a suite of selective modules specifically tailored to the requirements of students and teachers. It is engineered and designed considering range of management functions needed within the college. Almost all departments within a baisc need (e. g. attendence, notices, time table etc) can be synchronized and accessed.
*** 
__<h2>ARCHITECTURE</h2>__

Both the iOS and Android versions of our app follow approximately the same underlying structure for storing and associating data. At the heart of the application is a series of interrelated classes (each of which also happens to correspond with a table in a database).

* __Ionic 3__ for Moblie Frontend
* __Firebase__ for Backend 
* __Django__

***
__<h2>PROGRESS</h2>__
    We are still deciding the database schema for the application, frontend work will finish in one and a half day as soon as we finish mocking up data and making relationships.
